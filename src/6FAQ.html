        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>Who are travel landers?</p>
        <p> We help people travel better by connecting curious travelers with exceptional local guides, worldwide. Our mission is to curate the best experiences from every country people travel to.
            What started as an idea in June 2006 became our company in November 1992.
            After an experience visiting the Great Wall of China and meeting some local women who shared some in depth history of the wall in exchange for local souvenirs, 
            Paul and Dave started to think about how to give these women a platform where they can safely connect with travellers to deliver tours that share their vast local knowledge, 
            and be compensated appropriately for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I’ve not had a response back from my guide, what should I do?</p>
        <p>spacer We expect guides to reply within 24-48 hours to every traveller inquiry. 
            <em>If it's been more than 48 hours since you sent your email, we encourage you to <a href="3Contact_us.html">contact us</a> to follow up.</em>
            Please note: answers to questions regarding specific details about the tour (i.e. pricing, transportation, itinerary, etc.) must come from the guide.
            Customer Support will assist in facilitating prompt email contact between yourself and the guide; however, to set proper expectations, 
            it should be noted that during high season, response times from the guides will depend on volume of inquiries and bookings. 
            Guides typically conduct their administrative duties during their off-hours in order to deliver the very best tour experiences possible.
            We thank you for your patience and understanding during these busy seasons.</p>

        <p>How does Travel Lander work?</p>
        <p>Our talented team recruits and selects the very best guides around the world. Only after successfully meeting our criteria and reference checks are they allowed to post their tours and profiles on our site.
            We have over 700 phenomenal guides in more than 30 countries!
            We have thousands of tours on our site ready for you to book online (or by phone) any time. 
            Don’t see exactly what you’re looking for? Contact the guides directly to create a fully customised private tour to suit your needs, 
            then book and pay for that tour online. All of our tours are fully private and customisable</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Do I need to tip my guide?</p>
        <p><strong>No</strong>. You do not need to tip your guide; it is not expected. However, the guide may accept a tip, if offered.
            All the guides set their tour prices to ensure they are appropriately compensated for their time. As such they do not rely on tips from tours.
            All guides are aware of this policy.
            If you would like to help your guide, you can leave a thoughtful review of your tour for future travellers to see.</p>
